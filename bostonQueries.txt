All 4 are causes for the exact point: example: crim 0.006	rm	6.575 tax 296		lstat 4.98	medv: 28.43873128


Partial cause found rm actual value is 6575.0 solved value 6721.0
Partial cause found tax actual value is 296000.0 solved value 298394.0

Partial cause found rm actual value is 6575.0 solved value 14540.0
Partial cause found tax actual value is 296000.0 solved value 6531254.0

One cause: crim infeasible
